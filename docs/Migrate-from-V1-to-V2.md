# Guid to migrate from V1 to V2

We did our best to make sure that SurveyJS Creator V2 compatible with V1. Unfortunately, we made a lot of changes and the biggest one is the support react and later other JavaScript frameworks. We have to divide our code from knockoutjs and this could not change the code dramatically.

Moreover, SurveyJS Creator V2 UI changed dramatically. It is not a face lifting. It is a deep re-design and re-thinking based on our customers and users feedback.

If we are talking about technical and internal code changes, then the biggest change in V2 that we have replaced custom UI in property grid, logic tab, translation tab, Embedded Survey tab with Survey widget. In fact, we are creating all forms using our own Survey. Since Survey Library is already support different frameworks and it has been tested on accessibility and other important functionality, it let us to support react framework and soon other platforms comparatively easy. It creates some incompatibility with V1, for example in creating adorners and custom property editors, but we strongly believe it costs it.

For compatibility reason, when it is possible, we are logging warning into console that a function/property from V1 doesnâ€™t work in V2 and you need to use another approach or parameters.

## Knockout version

If you are going to continue to use the knockout version, then in most cases you will need to make two changes:

### Step 1. Change JavaScript and CSS links

You will need to change the links to the Survey Library. We are using the same library, but for Creator V2 you will need SurveyJS Library slitted on two modules: framework independent part (core) and framework depended on part (knockout in our case).

In our case it will be:

```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/survey-core@SurveyJSVersion/survey.core.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/survey-knockout@SurveyJSVersion/survey-knockout-ui.min.js"></script>
```

Instead of one link in V1:

```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/survey-knockout@SurveyJSVersion/survey-ko.min.js"></script>
```

You will need to make sure to remove the old SurveyJS Creator V1 links and replace it with new:

```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/survey-creator@SurveyJSVersion/survey-creator-knockout.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://unpkg.com/survey-creator@SurveyJSVersion/survey-creator-knockout.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/>
```

### Step 2. Optionally change constructor parameters and explicitly call render function

You will need to make sure to call the render function to render the Creator widget. We do not render SurveyJS Creator in constructor, and we can do it V1. Moreover, we will log a warning in the console if you pass a DOM element or element id into constructor as the first parameter. We will simply ignore it. It means instead of one line of code in V1:

```javascript
var creator = new SurveyCreator.SurveyCreator("creatorElement", options);
```

You will need at least two lines of code in V2:

```javascript
var creator = new SurveyCreator.SurveyCreator(options);
//Add event handlers, survey JSON and any customization code you need here
creator.render("creatorElement");
```

In the most cases, that is all you need to do. We will discuss advanced changes later.

## React version

We did not have SurveyJS Creator for react framework before. React developers use V1 knockout version as a black box. Now SurveyJS Creator V2 for react and a truly react widget and it should be used a common react widget. It does not mean that all your code that you have created for V1 will go into trash if you are using react in your application. The most code will be still valid, except the code that deals with rendering and some advanced functionality as custom property editors.

If you migrate your application with SurveyJS Creator from V1 into V2 then you will need to make sure to use the correct packages.

You will require to install `survey-creator-react`. It depends on `survey-react-ui` and `survey-core` that will be installed as well.
Your Survey Creator component code can look like this:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import * as SurveyCreator from "survey-creator-react";
import "survey-core/modern.css";
import "survey-creator-react/survey-creator-react.css";

class SurveyComponent extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
        const options = { showLogicTab: true };
        this.creator = new SurveyCreator.SurveyCreator(options);
        //Add event handlers, survey JSON and any customization code you need here
    }
    render() {
        return <SurveyCreator.SurveyCreatorComponent creator={this.creator} />;
    }
}

export default SurveyComponent;
```

## Custom property editor

We are using SurveyJS Library to render property grid in V2. It means that old code, related in creating custom property editors, that works in V1 will not work in V2 at all. The good news, it becomes easy to set up a new property grid editor in V2. All you need is to tell SurveyJS Creator what question type you want to use for a particular property.
Here is the simple example:

```javascript
//Register a new property for all questions
Survey.Serializer.addProperty("question", {
    name: "shortname",
    type: "shorttext",
    isRequired: true,
    category: "general",
    visibleIndex: 3
});

//Register a new property editor for this property type
SurveyCreator.PropertyGridEditorCollection.register({
    //Returns true for a property with type "shorttext"
    fit: function (prop) {
        return prop.type === "shorttext";
    },
    //Returns a typical question JSON. This question will be used to edit this property value
    getJSON: function (obj, prop, options) {
        return { type: "text", maxLength: 5 };
    }
});
```

You can override and use your own property editor for any property you want by returning true in the `fit()` function.

## Custom adorners

We do not use after render technique in SurveyJS Creator V2 and render additional widgets for survey elements on design surface using a platform standard approach. Templates for knockout and react components for react. As result, the old code will not work as well for rendering custom adorners will not work. SurveyJS Creator will simply ignore it.

In V2 you can use `onDefineElementMenuItems` event to insert a new action into standard actions. You can modify standard actions as well or modify them. The following code inserts "Start with new line" action before the "delete" action for all questions.

```javascript
creator.onDefineElementMenuItems.add((sender, options) => {
    //If element doesn't have property define than it is not a question
    if (options.obj.startWithNewLine === undefined) return;
    var question = options.obj;
    //Define a new bar item
    var barItem = {
        //Unique id
        id: "startWithNewLine",
        css: () =>
            question.startWithNewLine ? "sv-action-bar-item--secondary" : "",
        //item text
        title: "On new line",
        //Icon to render that depends on a property
        iconName: () => {
            if (question.startWithNewLine) {
                return "icon-switchactive_16x16";
            }
            return "icon-switchinactive_16x16";
        },
        //Action on click
        action: () => {
            question.startWithNewLine = !question.startWithNewLine;
        }
    };
    //Find where is the "delete" action
    var index = -1;
    for (var i = 0; i < options.items.length; i++) {
        if (options.items[i].id === "delete") {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    //Insert before delete action or at the end
    if (index > -1) {
        options.items.splice(index, 0, barItem);
    } else {
        options.items.push(barItem);
    }
});
```
